# Design System Demo

## Project Overview
The Design System Demo is a simple showcase demonstrating a design system built with Bootstrap components. It allows developers to see how customizable variables affect the appearance of various components within a Bootstrap-based framework. The project uses a custom CSS file to override Bootstrap's default variables, providing a unique look and feel.

## Installation
To get started with the Design System Demo, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd design-system-demo
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.**
   Simply double-click on the file or use a web server to host it locally.

## Usage
The demo showcases multiple sections, including:
- Atoms: Simple components like typography, buttons, and form controls.
- Molecules: Combinations of atoms such as input groups and alerts.
- Organisms: More complex components like card groups and forms.
- Templates: Layout examples for various use cases like blog posts and dashboard stats.

Just navigate through the components using the sticky navigation bar at the top of the page.

## Features
- Customizable theme properties using CSS variables.
- Smooth scrolling behavior for better user navigation.
- Responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.
- Examples of Bootstrap atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates integrated into one cohesive design system.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following dependencies:
- **Bootstrap**: Front-end framework for responsive design.
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library used for various icons within the UI.
- **Google Fonts**: Provides the "Inter" font for better typography.
