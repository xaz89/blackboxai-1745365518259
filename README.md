# Design System Demo

## Project Overview
The Design System Demo is a showcase of Bootstrap components with customizable variables. It implements a design system that utilizes CSS custom properties to overwrite Bootstrap's default styles while providing an interactive interface for exploring UI components such as buttons, forms, cards, and much more. The project aims to demonstrate best practices for modern web development utilizing responsive and accessible design principles.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd design-system-demo
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your web browser:** 
   You can simply double-click the `index.html` file or serve it using a local server.

3. **No additional installations are required** since this project does not rely on any server-side technologies.

## Usage
Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the design system demo. The page includes navigation links to various sections showcasing:
- Atoms: Basic UI elements like typography and buttons.
- Molecules: Combinations of UI elements, such as input groups and alerts.
- Organisms: More complex components, including forms and card groups.
- Templates: Layouts demonstrating the arrangement of components.

You can interact with these components to see how they behave with the applied styles.

## Features
- **Customizable Bootstrap Variables:** Overrides Bootstrap's default CSS properties through CSS custom properties.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilizes Bootstrap’s grid system to ensure a responsive layout across various screen sizes.
